                <p><strong>What is the Mini-Game Coaster?</strong></p>

                <p><em>Minigame Coaster is a sub-section of Mini-Game Land in Mario Party 2. It's up to 9 worlds long and is a trial system in which you have to beat out CPU players in different minigames on varying difficulties.</em></p>

                <p><em>My current PBs are as follows:</em></p>

                <blockquote><ul>
                <li><em>N64 Normal Coaster: <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/mic_feedback/c/5107283">00:30:59.26</a> [WR]</em></li>
                <li><em>N64 Hard Coaster: <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/mic_feedback/c/5060938">00:48:40.54</a> [WR]</em></li>

                </ul>
                </blockquote>

                <p><strong>Why do you have to pick a second player?</strong></p>

                <p><em>During 2V2 minigames, you need a partner to help you. As such, the game has you pick a dedicated partner that will be your personal AI in all 2V2 minigames.</em></p>

                <p><strong>Oh! So does that mean co-op?</strong></p>

                <p><em>No, it does not. Co-op would make this game horrendously unbalanced (In this mode, anyways). You'd have the option to gang up on enemy AI and make half of the more difficult games very easy. As such, this is a SINGLE PLAYER MODE. There is not, nor will there ever be, co-op for this mode.</em></p>

                <p><strong>But why would you even need to pick a partner though?</strong></p>

                <p><em>For the sake of consistency. It's easier to give a player a partner character that will never appear as an adversary against you rather than partner you with a random character each time, thus confusing you when you can't determine which partner character on screen is yours. It's silly.</em></p>

                <p><strong>What is the current World Record for this?</strong></p>

                <p><em>The TAS for Hard Mode is about 45 minutes in length. The current WR For Hard on N64 is 00:48:40.54 and Normal is 00:30:59.26. The WR for Wii VC on Hard (though unofficial) is 00:51:19.33 and Normal is 00:30:32.94. All four records were set and are currently upheld by myself (Which isn't saying much since I'm currently uncontested).</em></p>

                <p><strong>Why are N64 and Wii VC separated?</strong></p>

                <p><em>There's a gross difference in frame rate, lag, etc between N64 and Wii VC, with Wii VC being the faster of the two. Because the difference is so staggering, I've decided to have both categories separated with N64 being the standard.</em></p>

                <p><strong>But if Wii VC is faster, why not make VC the standard???</strong></p>

                <p><em>There's a lot of controversy revolving around Wii VC versions for quite a few games. With MP2, I noticed the time difference almost immediately, but I didn't want to ban Wii VC because it's easy to get a hold of and a lot cheaper than getting an N64 hard copy. That said, I believe the challenge of running it on N64 is more worthwhile and impressive, thus why I made N64 the standard.</em></p>
